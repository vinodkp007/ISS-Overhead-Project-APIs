The above project is a creative and overwhelming project personally for me because the project has a fascinating feature of sending mail to our mailbox when an International space station satellite is over us, that is if we specify our location.

To explain more about it, It sends us a mail when ISS is over our head so if we look in the sky when we recieve a mail, we can look at a star kind of thing moving faster in the sky which is satellite

Story ends there, Lets get into the Coding and Structure part

"YOUR MAIL" --> Replace by your Mail

"YOUR PASSWORD" --> Replace by your Mail password given after 2 step verification by your Mail

NOTE: The project has used gmail to send mails so it is better to go with it without changing the code for better experience

With all that let everyone get a chance to watch a mighty star ISS over our home having a cup of coffee (hopefully)
